		<h3>Viper Kai History</h3>
		<p>Viper Kai was founded by our Sensei, John, in 2020. Once a soldier the Vietnam War, John came home all those years ago and founded a dojo right here in the valley. However, due to certain complications, John was forced to shut down the dojo after a few years and take a leave of absence. After 35 years of traveling the world on a journey of self-discovery, John has returned with a passion to teach the next generation the lessons he has learned.</p>
		<p>Viper Kai is built on the idea that power is created from discipline, integrity, and intuition.  </p>

	<div id="discipline">
		<h3>Viper Kai Discipline</h3>
		<p>Viper Kai is not set on one form, or style, of martial arts. Our founder believes in mastering many forms of offence and defense. A wide variety makes a strong warrior. Some of the arts we practice are Karate, Taekwondo, Tang Soo Do, and Goku Ryu. Though we have a layout based more on these arts, Viper Kai is as willing to learn as you are. If you know of new forms and styles, share them with us! </p>

	<div id="levels">
		<h3>Viper Kai Membership Levels</h3>
		<p>Your training at Viper Kai is based on your current membership level, which in turn is based on your current level of skill. The four membership levels are: Basic, Intermediate, Advanced, and Expert. Basic is for beginner students, with little or no martial arts training. Intermediate is for students who may have had some formal training, but have not yet progressed very far. Advanced is for those students who have had a significant amount of training and are ready to put their skills to the test. And Expert is for the best of the best only, those with a passion to take their skills the ultimate level.</p>
		<p>When you first join Viper Kai, your instructor will conduct an interview and skill assessment to determine your best fit. Once assigned a level and a belt color, you will then commence training in the skills required to advance from your current level to the next.</p>
