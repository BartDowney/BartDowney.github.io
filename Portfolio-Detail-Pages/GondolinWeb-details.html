              <p>During my second-to-last semester in the Software Developer program, I found myself in the Software Architecture class, which was designed to start the process of bringing all of the knowledge we had been acquiring throughout the program into focus.</p>
              <p>The first third of the semester involved a series of assignments centered around database design and access, as we used a .NET framework to develop a web application that allowed us to utilize skills we had learned previously, such as SQL and Stored Procedures, to construct a working order-taking system that was able to interact with a local database using all aspects of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) functions.</p>
              <p>The rest of the semester was taken up with a team project, where we were tasked with coming up with our own web application that would successfully showcase everything we knew. My four-person team, dubbed Team Gondolin, decided to design a task management application which we eventually called GondolinWeb.</p>
              <p>GondolinWeb allows users to register themselves with the application, and then create projects and tasks that they can track, modify, and delete, all housed within a database that we designed. It was a relatively straightforward project, but as it was our first exposure to the Asp.NET framework in C#, there was a bit of a learning curve. We decided to implement Asp.NET Core Identity for the user registration process, and also used the Entity Framework Core development process, as we felt that allowed us an easier time working with the database.</p>
              <p>My role in the team was primarily focused on the front-end, following good User Experience practices to develop an eye-pleasing appearance, as well as paying attention to the flow of the application. I was responsible for the color scheme and graphics of the site and the ability to select a different theme, along with the overall layout of each of the pages. I did do my fair share of back-end work, as well, in particular developing certain features such as the QuickList and a lot of the task management functionality.</p>
              <p>The result was a professional, fully-realized web application that hit all of our goals and was presented with much positive feedback at the end of the semester. At this time, there is unfortunately no live version of GondolinWeb hosted anywhere, but I do have the code uploaded to my personal Github repository, which you can access by using the link above.</p>
