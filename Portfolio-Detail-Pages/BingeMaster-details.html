              <p>For my final assignment in my Semester 4 Web Programming 1 class, we were tasked with creating a web application using PHP, utilizing an MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern. I quickly learned that the PHP language is not optimally suited to the MVC pattern, so a lot of work went into designing a custom framework for that. In addition, I had to design and create my own database structure, another new exercise for me, and it was also my first foray into utilizing an API, which was not taught during the class, but something I had to research and learn on my own.</p>
              <p>The result was the BingeMaster3000, an application which allows registered users to select any number of past or current television shows and then keep track of how many minutes they have spent watching those shows, as well as minutes remaining for all the shows they have selected. It successfully utilizes my custom PHP MVC framework, along with consuming a remote API to drive the entire functionality of the core features of the app.</p>
              <p>In addition to the more technical aspects, I took the opportunity to have a little fun with this assignment. In particular, I was able to use the BingeMaster3000 to showcase my ever-expanding front-end coding skills and create a television graphic as the centerpiece of the user experience. The entire graphic is 100% pure CSS, which made it easy to customize, and is even interactive, with the TV buttons actually used as the links to navigate through the application. It's also very responsive to various screen sizes, and just looks pretty neat, if I do say so myself, especially with the static effect. Honestly, it is one of the projects I am the most proud of.</p>
