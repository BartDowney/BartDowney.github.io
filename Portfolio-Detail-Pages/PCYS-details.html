              <p>The culmination of the Software Developer program at MSTC is the Capstone class, where we are tasked with leveraging all that we have learned over the course of the program into a final project that allows us to showcase our skills.</p>
              <p>For my Capstone project, I was put on a team with three other final semester students where we were given the opportunity to build an application for a real client, an actual product that would eventually be used by real people. Partnering with the Portage County Youth Soccer organization, Team Null took on the challenge of building a scheduling application that would allow coaches to schedule their games and practices at the PCYS soccer facility in Stevens Point, Wisconsin, and also give the public easy access to search and view the schedule.</p>
              <p>This was the first time in our college career that we were working with an actual client, and as the Product Owner for Team Null, it was my job to act as the liason between this client and the other members of the development team. It was also my responsibility to maintain the backlog in our Jira system, creating and assigning tasks to team members and making sure they were completed, Peer Reviewed, and merged in a timely manner. I also ran the Sprint Reviews at the end of every two-week development cycle, presenting each deliverable iteration of our application to the client, and I conducted Sprint Planning and Retrospective operations at the beginning and end of each cycle, as well.</p>
              <p>In addition to these administrative tasks, I was also responsible for a great deal of the coding within the application, mainly in the front-end, where my particular set of skills was most useful. Specifically, I created the calendar that became the centerpiece for most of the functionality of the app, and also the interactive scheduling grid that gives coaches and admins a more visual and dynamic means of executing their scheduling processes. I did quite a bit of work in the back-end, as well, consistently displaying my penchant for troubleshooting and fixing problem areas in the code throughout the length of the project.</p>
              <p>The result was an end product that exceeded the expectations of the client. They and our instructors were very pleased with the PCYS Scheduler app, and it is something that our team is proud to have accomplished, especially in so short a timeframe.</p>
