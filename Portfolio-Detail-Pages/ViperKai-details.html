            <div class="portfolio-description">
              <p>In my second semester of the Software Developer course, I took the User Experience class, my first exposure to that realm of software development which has less to do with coding, and more to do with discovering what a user expects from a product and how to make that happen.</p>
              <p>Throughout the course of this class, we were taught the importance of gathering requirements and formulating goals, as we developed User Profiles and User Personas, then constructed User Journeys from these, which in turn generated User Stories, a critical element in the development process. We also learned several other tools and techniques for guiding the overall direction of the project, such as card sorting, mood boards, and usability tests.</p>
              <p>The ultimate goal of the class was to eventually build a working prototype of the end product, an actual website that in a real-life situation would be presented to the stakeholders as proof-of-concept. Using taxonomy and wireframes, I built this site to portray the execution of the overall vision, as well as proper routing and site navigation. As an added flair, I contracted my daughter, who had recently graduated from college with a degree in art, to create a realistic logo for my fictional dojo.</p>
              <p>The result is the Viper Kai Dojo website that's linked above. Screenshots of several of the materials gathered throughout the process are also included in the photo gallery.</p>
              <p>I want to note that one of the most interesting aspects of this User Experience class was that the assignment was designed to be a team project, and the students were divided on the first day into teams of four to progress through the semester towards the end product. However, by the third week of the semester, all three of my other teammates had dropped the class for undisclosed reasons, leaving me to complete the entire project on my own.</p>
              <p>A little intimidated by this turn of events, I nonetheless took this as a great example of a situation that might very well occur in a real professional environment. Though at times I became somewhat overwhelmed, since I was also taking three other classes during that semester, I knuckled down and pushed through, eventually completing every piece of the project and achieving a perfect score in the class. Though the site itself is not my greatest work (since it is, after all, just a prototype, and it was also only my second semester in the program), I am nevertheless proud of what I accomplished, and it allowed me to learn enough to know that the User Experience field is definitely most suited to my particular set of skills.</p>
