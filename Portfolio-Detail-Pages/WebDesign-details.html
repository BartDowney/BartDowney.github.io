              <p>During the summer of 2022, I was employed by the IT Department of MSTC to be an intern for the Software Developer program instructors. My project for the summer was to work with the instructors to create a revised student syllabus for a particular class, with a new graphical presentation and a particular focus on inclusionary language. One of the most important aspects of the syllabus was not only the ability for the instructors to easily modify it going forward, so it could be used in future semesters, but also to provide a working example for new syllabi in other classes.</p>
              <p>As such, I was able to create a template document that could be accessed by the instructors before the start of each semester, changing dates and locations and other information that would be different from year to year. It was also presented to other instructors as a guide for developing syllabi for their own courses, and the process has been started to revamp materials across the curriculum of MSTC.</p>
              <p>At the same time, I was also tasked with building a website that would not only provide students in the course with links to this new syllabus, but also other reference materials germane to the class. The instructors desired an easy-to-use and informative repository for information not only of a general nature, but also specific for each module of the class week by week. It was up to me to write and present this information in a way that was helpful to new students, as well as connected to the actual course materials being used in the class.</p>
              <p>The resulting website was used immediately in the 2022 Fall Semester of the Web Design 1 class, giving them access to a wealth of information that I was subsequently told was very welcome and helpful.</p>
